If you want to check what it does go to this link and you can try it out.

If you really want to download the files and run it locally then follow the instructions below. (It's just effort though like cmon bro)

1. cd into the folder where all the files are being held
2. In your terminal run 'npm init -y'
3. Then run 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install all the node modules
4. lastly run 'nodemon index.js' and in your browser go to the URL 'localhost:3000'
